 sorcerers_conclave_reform_desc:0 "The Sorcerers' Conclave rules with an iron grip, blending religious authority and magical supremacy to control every aspect of Chaos Dwarf society. At its heart are the Sorcerer-Prophets, both priests of Hashut and practitioners of destructive sorcery, who hold dominion over the forge, the battlefield, and the populace. Their slowly petrifing forms sit upon basalt thrones, directing their disciples to expand their industrial empire and enforce their will through fire and slavery. The Conclave rewards ambition and devotion while ensuring that dissent is crushed beneath the molten fist of Hashut. Power flows to those who prove their worth in magic, industry, and sacrifice."

 chaos_dwarfs.1.desc:0 "The current Sorcerer-Prophet grows closer to petrification, and the Ashen Throne demands a successor. In the forges of Zharr-Naggrund, rival candidates sharpen their axes, conjure daemonic pacts, and prepare sacrifices to Hashut. Who shall ascend and guide the Dawi-Zharr to dominance?"
