	non-steam needs a slightly different file structure, with the descriptor file in the mods folder alongside the mod files themselves, and a line added to point to the right directory (path="C:\Users\admin\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis IV\mod\warhammer_fantasy_universalis-main") but yes! works perfectly after that modification! thank you so much :)

	Starting Localization or events about Kislev

	Give everybody (or mostly everybody) the intolerant modifier: -4 accepted culture, -25% culture conversion cost. With a painful decision to get rid or reduce it.
		Or just add it to racial modifiers

	Change ulthuan flag: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1318955446697988126/1319193642317119550

	The "Resurrect Strygos" decision doesn't work for the Sires of Mourkain.

	Skaven province event for neighborind non-skaven city - gives gold, delivers devasation

	Give queek more units to start

	Balance the war for 8 peaks

	Give Chaos Monsters

	Have resurrect Nagash

	Make finding the grail possible! Is it?

	What happens if Clan Grey Seer is killed?

	Formables
		Ogre Formable
		Badland Orc/Hobgoblin formable
		Borderland Orc formable

	Event chains that are ressurections of historic figures

	Move the Western Mountains out of the Underempire continent? Currently they are in the same continent as the main skaven underempire provinces, resulting in abnormaly high AE comrped to taking underway entrances  of other regions?

	Undersea Canal: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1317611560704802946/1317611560704802946

	Offer vassalization to dominions through the normal means?

	Nurn cannot be added to the empire - It needs to be in the continent of europe to be able to. This makes it impossible to invite the southern border princes without going around through the black fire pass

	Two popups for ending the end times https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1315782027534008420/1317095941404229662

    Implant cult can only target capitals if they are the only possible province

	I know its a minor detail but elves in Warhammer fantasy on avaradge live to 1000 years without the aid of magical means. (My guy is 985 so no problem for me but just something): https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1314656598051913818/1317188732939669657

	Event for the reciever of the orc/skaven city raiding mission

	Change Chaos missions around estates
		The only option for if you want to 'reform' a chaos warband of a chaos waste culture into a government instead of playing tribal till the everchosen arrives.

	The norscan tribe gov-reform doesn't operate for Kurgan Culture, so is instantly suspended, however switching to the Tribes of Chaos would also mean you lose all your current territory and become migratory.

	Could force raiding for AI allied with Players in a war, but that feels kinda cheaty. Maybe if they have a certain amount of trust?

	Final Empire Centralization reform doesn't work!
	
	Use on_war_won (or equivalent) with national set_flags to set the racial war missions

	As Etaine I colonized some provinces in Dawn's Light (Equivalent to South Africa) but can't add them to a trade company. For references, I have all DLCs.

	i dont think its possible to pass the reforms without fighting all the electors: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1314656598051913818/1316839640489263136

	Events for Skaven nand orcs - bored war party - mneightbors get rebels (and you get opinion modifier), or you get rebels

	Not sure if this is a bug but why do some nations only have one tradition? Example Stirland, Averland, and Talabecland

	The Nehekharan Pantheon should have a decision you can take every so often which allows you to switch which diety you follow, since your rulers are immortal you're locked in unless you choose to get them killed
		Based on Norsca?

	War for karak8peaks - Clan Angrun U37 war names don't work - "No War Name"

	Playtest Bretts

	is a dominion meant to cost twice as much AE as non-dominions?

	At start of end times all good nations like each other more

	Khorne Sacrifice events and decisions working?

	Raid Neighbors Wood Elf Mission
		Correct me if i'm wrong but this was implemented with all provinces scope and checked for neighbor provinces when it could be scoped directly to neighbors, couldn't it?

	tried swapping to a theocracy as the albion fimir, it just took away two reform tiers and i stayed tribal, monarchy worked fine, havent tried republic

	Expand empire diplomatically? Can it be done?

	More imperial Authority earned? - Will happen naturally through Balkanization

	It doesn't seem to go through if you full annex a race, and I would also suggest promoting a culture should work in place of trust but that's just me.

	Gell's suggested flavor decisions/events: https://discord.com/channels/@me/1315325752035770490/1315327269371379712

	Remove Dev Cost from state edicts

	Mix up Tilean Governments: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1316226022504402965/1316226022504402965

	Many more cultures! Double the number of cultures in each culture group.

	Adjust Age Bonuses and Localization for Age bonuses
		Be a Ruinous power with over 200 development
		or
		Be at war with a Ruinous power

	When Nukabear is done with the map stuff
		Name nudging
		Use excel to find name duplicates, and rename them
		Nudging and name changes: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1319433629692330096/1319433629692330096

	Raiding
		Recently Raided is weird. 
		But then you can't selectively raid?
		Should it go away at the end of the war? Clear all recently raided?
		Raiding happens when people reclaim their own lands
		Might be fixed, check if this works. - Nope!
		Can't toggle it off during war, but all provinces that you take in the war get 100% devastation.
		Or
		Maybe you can't undo the decision while at war, but while it is on all of your warscore requests cost twice as much.
		Rethink Raiding, chat with Theia
			WHAT IF RACIAL RAIDING IS AN END OF WAR PEACE OFFERING? THAT TAKES 75 WARSCORE? But that would mean you actually need to win the war, which kind of defeats the purpose
		Or you only do it in a raiding war?


	Trade
		I think the Vaults Trade node doesnt make sense getting money from karaz - a - Karak lore wise. I think it makes more sense that it works as a starting node (a rich one but still one) that sends to Karaz - a - Karak as lore wise Karaz - a - Karak is the center of dwarven economics since before the fall of the karaz Ankor, especially without Karak Eight Peaks. 
		Its a Underway junctions getting the northern holds and those in the vaults, in the same way Vala Azril Ungol was a great underway junction from the southern holds.
		Elf trade network stuff: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1314080313055510529/1315004963214200913
		Trade Stuff: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1315715354114129960/1315715354114129960
		its a little frustrating that the Worlds Edge Mountains trade nodes and the rest of the worlds trade nodes have almost no interaction whatsoever except at the very south of the whole range and the very north. it kinda makes it so that other than the 3 trade nodes in the main worlds edge mountains area, dwarfs really dont get to use any of the other trade nodes as theres no way to path them back to your capital. 
		Very odd considering there are 3 different times when a trade route passes through a mountain pass that directly leads to the inside trade nodes of the mountains, one of which literally passes within 1 province of the dwarves capitol. 
		i have more production in my country than the next 6 highest producers in the entire world all feeding into only 3 trade nodes, all of which i have 100% control over feeding into my capital node, and its still not enough to get the #1 most valuable trade node requirement for global trade
		Trade routes in general could probably use more movement, I notice a lot of beginner nodes that feel like they could make receive trade, or push in other directions
		Skavenblight trade node is funky. Nevermind, its actually where skavenblight is in lore. Although i'd argue still to move it to ease confusion and also for practically nations in skavenblight itself can't get trade from it.

	Add Monuments
		Also there should be various monuments in the various peaks of Vala Azril Ungol
		Bretonnia has only one monument as well, I would have at least expected a vinyard or the like, or a port that buffs up their navy to reflect the lore of them having a really damn strong navy
		Bordeleaux should have either a port or a vinyard, and Moussilion is think would probbaly deserve a monument as well
		Shrine of Khaine as a monument?
		Oh and also I believe Black pit should be made into normal province. Since its cool place where all those huge spiders live and breed. Could possibly host two diffrent monuments even. One for goblins that use those huge spiders and commune with them to control them. 
		And the second monument or artifact could be Dark Heart. I belive i've heard somewhere that it is actually stored somwhere there. Not 100% sure tho.

######### Nuka_Bear Stuff #########
#############################

	As you can see from the screenshot, moving from the Knight's Vow to the Questing Vow reduces capacity of Grail Knights, even though it should increase it by 1 since the buff goes from +3 to +4. It seems like, because the +4 buff from the Questing Vow is nested beside the other buffs for Questing Knights regiments, it is erroneously applied. https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1317811261257416794/1317811261257416794

	Norscan Monster Hunt Mana Doesn't go away
		Stays even after the monster hunt finishes and only dissapears once your leader dies
		though it seemingly is only affecting diplo, I don't have a -1 for military and admin

	Audacity Brettonian mission not working

	Bret missions need better tooltips

	Grail Quest is all strange
		I would suggest changing the nature of the grail quest, because every time i try it i just get another heir before they come back, meaning louen is effectively the only grail knight you're ever going to get, maybe change it into a series of events? 

	On the latest patch 8/12/2024, strong stacks of beastmen assault the province repeatedly, roughly once every 2 to 3 years triggering via event.
		To wrap a minor suggestion into this, maybe beeckerhaven could have a province modifier that lets you remove the warherd via decision

	And for some reason you lose your bretonnian imperial vassals after some time and they become duke of some random bretonian king
		its from their crowning event
			When you form a subject over a brettonian duke and a new royarch gets crowned they become their subject again

	When selecting to go on a Monster Hunt with Norsca, the game gives you 3 optoins on what to hunt, but the last one is missing localization as seen by the picutre. This was reproduced with Skaelings.
		At the end of a succesful hunt, the possitive modifiers have placeholder text for "norsca_mammoth_trophy" and "norscan_hunt_fatigue"

######## MAP STUFF #######
#############################

	Put on Dev Bounty Board

		The Golden Plains are isolated on water, with a single unclear crossing connection, with a crossing connection to Varn Drazh lake, but go to the adjacent Wheatlands Farmlands, if you built a fort on that province you wouldn't be able to figure out where the connection to the capital is when attempting to siege it.

		When i tried searching up Varn Drazh it drew me here. Based off the crossing info in the top left of the province screen. (i changed government to horde of chaos just to test id lose the land)
			The actual pool of water golden plains is on, is called cursed hollow

		4529 Has connections but is missing tunnels

		The provinces of Morcross and hauntcrag (Naggaroth) seem to be conected. I can also move there with my troops.

		Can build a boat in Ravola - It does finish building but is then invisible and can't move

		It seems the issue is that the ships are going to explore "debug_province (Sea)". When exploring this sea tile the ships go to the inexistent Silent Gulf and come back: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1315784539653541918/1316214657245122611

		Sharkfang Bay (1457) and Wailing Maw (1321) are connected

		Sea Tiles "Northern Verge" and "Scorpions Coast" connected

		Lore wise there should be a conection between Sjoktraken to Kraka Ravnsvake via the underground tunnel called the Ungruvalk

		Northern Verge is connected to Shatterskulls, and it shouldn't be

		I think the River Reik would enjoy being navigable, at least until Altdorf, After all after Mariengburg´s secession, the 1st Imperial Fleet is housed in its docks.

	Monstrous Military Ideas
		Just a simple military idea set, for nations that innately have monsters or evil techgroups that want to start building monsters from scratch, similarly to marine ideas force limit without having to name them individually.
		Just a idea throwup of the ordering and some kind of naming themes.
		Cossack Force Limit (0.5 per 100 development)
		Cavalry Maintenance ( Hounds of Chaos )
		10% Siege Power ( Giants at the Walls )
		Cossack Unit Fire ( Warpfire Horror Spew )
		20% force limit Expansion ( The Beastmen Wilderness )
		Garrison Attack Modifier ( Lair Nesting, useful for strong late game forts )

	I think you could Split colonial nations more. Like the Querveza (the green middle one in Lustria) could be split in 2 adding the Vampire Coast. Culchan the where the citadel of Dusk is could be split into a norther of the mountains and south of the mountains. 

	Change some HRE localization: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1319451494877102170/1319451494877102170

	I was reviewing how we handle units and special ones in the mod. EU4 has about 15 special unit types, such as Hussars and Streltsy. Currently, we add Hussars as Grail Knights, which effectively takes up a special unit slot for Bretonnians.
		The approach I suggest is to make Hussars into something more generic, like 'Magic Cavalry,' which can then be used across different nations. We could also create a special interface in the military tab to show the current Magic Cavalry unit type for each nation.

		We can use the is_hussars_modifier = yes flag to apply different bonuses to various nations.
		like if bret you get cav shock on your Magic Cavalry
		and if wood elfs you get cavalry fire
		and the  15 special unit types would be like  Magic Cavalry,  War Machine, Monster, Monster Cavalry, Expendable Infantry
		Expendable Infantry would be cheap and we could add them for as skaven slaves,  goblins slaves

	In averlorn i´d change the Gaen Vale to farmland (or hills if you dont want to stack too much dev reduction on the province) and put the magical forest in the slopes of the Anuilli mountains

	Do we need immortal? Or just increase lifespan

	Add Faceting and other events that change the price of goods

	Add in Beastmen as a playable faction.

	Necromancer and Vampire nations should be able to create set armies by decision/spell (if spell system is ever added) from nothing

	Decision for Greenskin and Skaven administrations to raid own lands!

	based on stuff like the weird amount of ogres ostland has and maneaters picking up things from their parent cultures

	Gov reform that allows chaos, skaven ,orcs to raid

	What about attempt to cure chaos influence for civilizations of world by building waystones?

	Decolonize Dragon isles? You could always give those dragon isle lizardmen the stateless society reform as a tribal government. Allow for them to reform into a normal nation again if they get some alternative means of directing society

	kislev cav is so dirt cheap lmao, I has it as same cost of infantry within the first 20 years

	New Religion

			8E and Fantasy Roleplay 4E state that Fimir are mostly concentrated in the wetlands of northern and western Old World (ie. largely concentrated in Norsca and Wastelands), but they are present elsewhere too, such as in Albion and Hybrasille (theorised to the new island shown in most recent maps of the Old World west of Albion).

	Have a Vampiric mission create a center of reformation

	Add Panama Canal
	Disaster and event series for high elves to unify and fight off invaders if they land in ulthuan. number of provinces owned by a nation not of the right religion or culture.
		Or just an event that encourages high elves to do it - if you declar war, you get prestige and more trust and love with everybody else on the island.

	End Times Drama
		Being next to the everchosen (or any chaos dude) makes rebels spawn in that province?

	Make various diplomatic actions cause a pop-up for the receiver. And offers?
		Offer to become dominion action?
		Pop up when you can vassalize dominions (Doesn't work)
		Convert Them

	Some relationship between racial administration and culture of individual province?

	Add the warhammer legendary lords into the map, with legendary traits

	Make end times start a country event, not a province event

	Use on-actions to Tie administration & mil to primary culture

	Intolerant, with decision to get rid of it

	Make all the tech ground and administration & military stuff come from primary culture?

	Norsca Nation can choose to civilize

	Send raiding party ability to lose manpower, damage relationship, and spawn a rebel army in an adjacent country

	Fightiness events that give manpower don't give manpower if you're already above max? They give mil power or something else?

	Add some islands? Increase colonial range?

#############################
######### NAH STUFF #########
#############################

Legitimate Successor government mechanic for Nehekhara & Cathay?
	Event at high legitimate successor to declare independence war? Maybe it's a defensive war to give them a chance?
	Event for the overlord to reign them in (declar war), or suffer penalty to own legitimacy
	Pretty slow moving
	Government scale for legitimate successor, with increasing diplomatic reputation and liberty desire. Higher, more liberty desire for self, less liberty desire for others.

	Generic Beacon on a Hill mission with tech difference not working

	If a Chaos tribe takes the chaos gate, they become they become everchosen?

	Give the hobgoblins fightiness?

	Change generic mission tree that gives claim rewards to be just provinces in culture group

	Should it be possible to change or have multiple racial administrations & militaries?
	To keep this balanced, either the racial admins/mils would need to be balanced with positives and negatives, or you get some broad negatives to counteract this. (like +unrest and unhappy estates for administration and -discipline for military)
	Maybe use the native religion reform mechanics for them? Aligns with slowly rebuilding/reforming the old empire
	Undead in particular is weird

A basic spell or two? Is mana = spell resource?
	Undead Spend 100 mil mana to gain a 10,000 manpower?

	Add Non-accepted culture governing cost increase back in - local_governing_cost = 1.0 ?

	Ruinous power getting great vortex should trigger an event that makes a center of reformation on the location.

	Give Estates to the Chaos Tribes - Impossible to do, native_mechanic = yes hardcodes it.

	Should all Old World Human cultures be in the same culture group?

###### Flavor Pack Ideas ######
#############################

Kislev
	Give religion a push pull between Ursun and the Ice Witches?
	Disaster for resurgance of the old ways
		Unrest and can't declare wars until it's sorted?
	Fix Icons for the ursun religion?
	Kislev: i would have put the northern territories at independent or 90%s autonomies. Especially Troll Country.
	For kislev, I would suggest an option to return to worshiping the ancient widow, possibly with some content related to the hags?
		in the original lore Thor, Dazh, and Ursun were the children of the ancient widow
		but in NuKislev the only god that gets any focus is Ursun
		to the point where their centerpiece unit is the big elemental bear

Skaven
	Betray special diplomatic action?
	Ultimate is all warp stone at a certain development for weapon of mass destruction decision to nuke enemies
	Give them access to all the diplomatic actions early
	How to make these two actions not require a diplomat?
	Form the underempire as skaven starts the vermintide, similar to everchosen mechanic

Norscans
	Change Ultimate - lame as is. Number of ships captured?
	there should probably be an option for a norscan nation to turn on the chaos gods and turn back to the old ways in a sort of challange mode since the chaosifying of norsca was a long gradual process

Chaos Tribes
	Government Type should allow estates? Make sure everybody up there is the right gov type and tech group
	Mix up the religions of the different provinces upt north

Empire
	I'm curious what the rationale is for representing Altdorf, Nuln, and Talabheim as Republics is. I know that they're "Free Cities" in Imperial parlence, but all three seem to also be hereditary monarchies. Altdorf is a principality, Talabheim a Grand Duchy, and Nuln a county.
		this is particularly strange in the case of Nuln
		as it makes there be two different Emmanuelle von Liebwitz characters
		one the feudal ruler of Wissenland, the other an elected mayor of Nuln
		when really the two should be in a personal union
	league wars between the Sigmarites and the cult of Ulric.
	Witch hunter estate for empire?
		Makes force converting people easier.
